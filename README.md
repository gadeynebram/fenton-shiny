# Fenton growth curves - shiny app

## Background
The raw data (L,M,S values) can be obtained in Excel format from Tanis Fenton (tfenton@ucalgary.ca). Afterwards, the data need to be reworked so that it follows the format of the csv files in the `data` folder in this github repository.

## Usage
Values can only be entered through a HTTP GET request:
- Gestational age (in weeks): `&PML_GET=23.14,23.28`. 23.145 equals 23 weeks + 1 day (=23+1/7).
- weight (in grams): &weight_GET=`400,500,600`
- length (in cm): `&length_GET=34,33,NA`
- head circumference (in cm): `&HC_GET=23,NA,25`
- Sex (M or F): `&sex_GET=M`
Furthermore, `?advanced=yes` needs to be specified.
